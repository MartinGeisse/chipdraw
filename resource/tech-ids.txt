Naming rules:
- segments are separated by a dash
- all LibreSilicon-related tech IDs start with the "LibreSilicon" segment
- next comes the tech generation segment. test000 to test999 are used for initial evaluation generations.
- next comes "concept" for conceptual design (e.g. simplified plane schema that does not separate diffusion/active)
    or a different segment for an actual manufacturing process
- for complete dies, the identifier ends there
- for cell libraries, the next segment are the initials or a similar mnemonic for the library designer, followed by
    a designer specific suffix for the library
