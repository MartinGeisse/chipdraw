The magic file format is very similar to our current understanding of what a design is.

Format-wise differences:
- (no longer) using a simple identifier as the technology ID
- we don't support labels yet

Conceptual differences:
- a magic / SCMOS file contains layers for transistors. We would not do that -- we would rather define a transistor
    to "emerge" for the overlap of diffusion and poly (this has the assumption that any overlap between diffusion
    and poly MUST be a transistor).

This conceptual difference is more of a technology-related difference than a difference in the format -- we could use
the same format for our technology. However, the main point of using Magic's file format is that we can exchange files
with Magic and related programs easily. This requires, apart from the file format, that our technology is represented
in all tools, and here is the problem: We don't really want to work in Magic/SCMOS because it's harder than
necessary, and we can't easly import our technology into Magic because (1) writing technology definition files seems
to be much more complex and (2) we don't even know if magic can handle the way we represent transistors (IIRC, their
model is slightly different from their file format).

For now, IMHO we are better off treating Magic's format as a "foreign" format with importers / exporters that may
lose information. Using Magic's format natively involves understanding the design process and how the tools are
working together -- which may be different for different users.

Format:
- OpenGL coordinate system (x = right, y = up)
- integer coordinates = grid nodes, not cell centers
- transistor areas are ecluded from poly (expected, since it's the same plane)
- transistor areas are excluded from diffusion (unxpected since they are on different planes)
    -> no, same plane!
- polycontact areas are excluded from poly (unexpected since they are on different planes)
    -> no, same plane!
- ndcontact areas are excluded from diffusion
-> all inter-layer things exclude those areas from the affected planes EXCEPT that well contacts do not exclude from wells
