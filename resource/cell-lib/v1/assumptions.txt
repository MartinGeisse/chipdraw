Power rails are: Vdd top, GND bottom. There are no alternating single rails and flipped cells, to simplify things.

Based on the routing considerations, cell sizes are multiples of 7 and routing ports are placed at 7-aligned positions.

Cell height is fixed to 140 (single-size) or aligned multiples of 140 (multi-size). Multi-size cells must route the
power rails to the next cells properly.

There won't be side ports (direct connections between neighbor cells purely on metal1 that bypass the routing layers).

Both n-wells and p-wells will be used to be independent from the actual well scheme from the technology. Separate wells
will be used per cell to fight off electrical noise.
